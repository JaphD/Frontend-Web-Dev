            Dark is a German Netflix series that ran for three seasons from 2017 to 2020. The show follows the residents of the fictional German town of Winden as they search for the truth after two children go missing. The series explores themes of fate, free will, and time through a complex network of flashbacks, flash-forwards, and parallel timelines. The show's protagonist, Jonas Kahnwald, discovers a network of caves that are linked to a time travel phenomenon and can travel through time using a portal. Jonas encounters past and future versions of himself, including himself, and can communicate with his future self, which could potentially change the course of history.
